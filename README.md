# Phase 1 code challenge 2

## THE GOAL
The code should create a simple to-do list app that allows users to add, clear, and mark items as purchased.

### FUNCTIONS 
There are four main functions that allows the user to add input,clear the list and mark purchased items;
-createList(): Updates the list container to show the current list of items.
-appendItem(): Adds a new item to the list and updates the list container.
-appendClearList(): Clears the list of items and updates the list container.
-appendPurchaseItem(): Marks an item as purchased and updates the list container.

### HOW IT WORKS
1) Adding Items: When the user clicks the "Add" button, the app takes the text from the input field, adds it to the list of items, and clears the input field. The list is then updated to show the new item.
2) Clearing the List: When the user clicks the "Clear" button, the app resets the list of items to empty, and updates the list container to show an empty list.
3) Marking Items as Purchased: When the user clicks the "Mark as Purchased" button, the app finds the currently selected item, marks it as purchased, and updates the list to show the item as purchased.
